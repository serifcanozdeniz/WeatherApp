<h1>WeatherApp</h1>

My latest project, created by combining the skills in my resume, is a weather application developed using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. This application operates seamlessly on all devices according to responsive design principles. Additionally, it provides a user-friendly experience with the ability to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

<h1>Libraries Used</h1>

Bootstrap
Font Awesome

<h1>Instant data</h1>

By leveraging a robust API integration to fetch weather data, the application presents real-time temperature information for all countries and cities worldwide. Users can easily track the current weather conditions of their desired regions.
